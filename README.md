## Overview
We were tasked with building an e-commerce site that enabled a user to select
and purchase items via a shopping cart.  Our product is designer watches.

## Technology Solutions
- Express
- MongoDB
- HTML, SCSS, jQuery & javascript
- Handlebars
- Bootstrap
- Stripe (for checkout)
- GitHub (for versioning and code sharing)

## Details
Day One was reserved for project planning.  We completed an ERD as well as a
majority of the user stories and plans to address.

- [Meeting Minutes for Day One Planning](http://evolutiontalk.com/images/modsquad/20161215.png)

Using the SCRUM methodology we kept each other updated on progress and adjusted
the day's activities as necessary.

Our initial approach was to divide the work into 3 sections:
- Backend
- Front End (API calls, Stripe Integration, etc)
- HTML and styling

By Day Two the back end was completed, as well as a working authentication process,
and we focused our efforts on the CRUD actions as a team
(essentially 'pair coding').
